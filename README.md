# Loan-Risk-Analysis
Identifying the creditworthiness of loan applicant and the risk associated with them using exploratory data analysis.
This project aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

This ensures that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this project.

In other words, I want to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. Hopefully, this information can be utilized for portfolio and risk assessment.
